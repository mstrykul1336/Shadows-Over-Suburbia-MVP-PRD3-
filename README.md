 **Play:**
 **Full Project:** https://github.com/mstrykul1336/Shadows-Over-Suburbia-Prototype-
 **11/25/24** 
**What was done**
- As a player, I want to see the current mouse sensitivity value so I can adjust it more accurately. (added a current text next to mouse sensitivity so the player knows what the mouse sensitivity is currently at)
- 
-As a player, I want the option to invert camera controls so I can play the game in a way that feels natural to me. (added an invert toggle to be able to invert the camera control)

-As a player, I want clear text explaining that character models are cosmetic and don’t affect gameplay so I can make informed choices. (changed character selection text to "character model" and added text to say that this will not have an effect on the gameplay, it's just cosmetic to address some of the confusion.)

-As a player, I want text in night and day cutscenes to clarify what’s happening in the game’s progression. (added text to the night and day cutscenes to hopefully make them a little more clear on what's happening.)

-As a player, I want all roles to have final drawn images so the game feels polished and visually complete. (all roles have their final drawn images.)

-As a player, I want the detective role implemented with its final image so I can enjoy a complete character experience. (the detective has their final drawn player image and has been implemented)

-As a player, I want the medic role implemented with its final image so I can enjoy a complete character experience. (the medic has their final drawn player image and has been implemented)

-As a player, I want the baker role implemented with its final image so I can enjoy a complete character experience. (the baker has their final drawn player image and has been implemented)

-As a player, I want the game to recognize and declare winners so I can feel rewarded for achieving victory. (winning works now! yay!)

-As a player, I want more time during the first day and extended day/night cycles so I can fully strategize and enjoy the gameplay (added more time to the first day time remaining, day cycle and night cycles)

-As a player, I want a lore-filled intro scene with voiceover and subtitles to immerse me in the game’s universe. (Added a new intro sequence scene where WiggleBlorp explains the lore behind the universe, including voice over (done by me) and subtitles)

-As a player, I want a basic tutorial with visual examples so I can understand the game mechanics before starting (Added in a basic tutorial in the intro scene for players to go over what the game is before playing with visual examples. )

-As a player, I want art for WiggleBlorp to enhance the game’s visual appeal and bring the character to life. (Drew art for wiggleblorp and added that. )

**To-Do: From user stories 4:**
-As a player, I would like my camera controls to be inverted so that I have an easier time walking around the room. / As a player I would like my controls to be inverted. (will be adding in option to invert it)

-As someone who likes having options for characters in a game, I would like some information on what's different about each character so I can weigh the pros and cons of each one. / As a new player, I would like to know more about the character types before selecting one. (will be adding in more lore about the roles and a disclaimer / info that the character selection screen is just for your character model) 

-As a new player, I would like to know more of what is happening during the cut scenes. / As a new player I would like some more insight as to what the cutscene was for.

-As a new player, I would like more time during the day cycle so that I have more time walk around and interact with players and NPCs. / As a player who is kinda slow, I would like some more time during both cycles to be able to think about what I want to do. (add more time) 

-As a new player, I would like some sort of intro sequence to be able to understand what is going on.

-As a confused player, I would like a tutorial mode so that I can figure out movement and UI before it is timed.

**-Tasks from me:**
-As a player who likes dramatic elements, I would like all roles to have their final drawn images. 

-As a player who likes challenge and good code, I would like the winning and losing to work properly.

-As a player who likes stories, I want to know the lore behind the game so I can better get into character. 

-As a player who likes stories, I want to know the lore behind each of the characters so I can better understand their motives.
